# Binance Trading Bot Overview

## Initialization and Setup:

- The Binance API is initialized with your API key and secret.
- The trading symbol is set to 'BTCUSDT' (Bitcoin to USDT), but you can replace it with any desired trading pair.

## Functions:

### `get_live_data(symbol)`

- Fetches live candlestick data for the specified symbol at a 1-minute interval and converts it into a Pandas DataFrame.

### `generate_signals(df)`

- Calculates trading signals based on Stochastic RSI, Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs), Average True Range (ATR), QQE, and Volume Flow Indicator (VFI).
- Defines buy and sell signals based on specified conditions.

### `execute_trade(symbol, side, quantity)`

- Places a market order (buy or sell) on Binance using the provided parameters.

## Main Loop:

- Continuously fetches live data using `get_live_data`.
- Generates trading signals using `generate_signals`.
- If a buy signal is generated, it executes a buy order using `execute_trade`.
- Monitors the position and, if the current price reaches the take profit or stop loss levels, executes a sell order.
- Waits for 1 minute before checking again.

## Note:

- The script is designed for educational purposes and should be used with caution in a real trading environment.
- Handle exceptions, implement risk management, and thoroughly test any trading strategy before deploying it in a live environment.
